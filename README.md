This repository contains a variety of examples which demonstrate how to use the Dream framework.

## Usage ##

To build and compile examples, firstly checkout the code:

	% git clone --recursive https://github.com/ioquatix/dream-examples.git

Then, compile `dream-framework`:

	% cd dream-examples/dream-framework
	% rake

At this point you can now build the examples using Xcode.

In the future we plan to support CMake for building examples too.
